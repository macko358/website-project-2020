  <h2 class=h21>Our Vision</h2>
  <p class=p3>We believe that your future is as important as ours. Our team believes in accommodating everyone for the
    future. That’s why we are dedicated to creating advanced technologies that will accelerate space exploration. We
    were the first company in the world to resettle humans onto an extraterrestrial planet after complications on Earth
    such as air and plastic pollution. Since then, humans have resettled to 13 different planets across the universe.
    Thanks to our specialised technology in space exploration, we can now travel at 1000 light-years per hour. There is
    never an end to our road, just like there is never an end to the future. </p>

    <h1 class=h22> Powered by Robotics</h1>
    <p class=p4>Our company could not be what it is without our self-built advanced robotics. There are over one billion
      robots operating in our company. These advanced technological robots employ state-of-the-art AI and machine
      learning to efficiently manufacture, create and produce our space technology.

    <h1 class=goalh1>Our Goals</h1>
    <div class=goal>
      <img src="goal1.png" alt="Atmos Tech" width=100 height=100>
      <p class=goalp1>We are completely committed to the safety and satisfaction of our customers. Our team always puts
        safety first. We test our space technology thoroughly to ensure that the customer’s well-being and security are
        in safe hands. We are constantly aiming to bring down our spacecraft accidents due to technical faults down to
        zero. </p>
    </div>
    <div class=goal>
      <img src="goal2.png" alt="Atmos Tech" width=100 height=100>
      <p class=goalp2>Create the Best Products and Services. We always set the bar when it comes to space technology.
        Our goal is to retain our position as the leading space exploration company in the world. That means creating
        the best products and services to suit the customer’s needs and satisfaction.</p>
    </div>
    <div class=goal>
      <img src="goal3.png" alt="Atmos Tech" width=100 height=100>
      <p class=goalp3>Contribute to society. We believe that when humanity is enduring a crisis, our company and team
        will create the necessary space technology to adapt to the situation and give a helping hand to humans in need.
        Just like when Earth was struck with climate change and overpopulation, we resettled humans onto other planets.
        Our goal is to give to humans in times of need, and most importantly contribute to society. </p>
